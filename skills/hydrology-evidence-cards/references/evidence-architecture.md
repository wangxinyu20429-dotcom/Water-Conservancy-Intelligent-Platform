# Evidence architecture V1.2

## Three layers

Source records an exact manifestation or release once. Claim records an atomic proposition, locator, evidence origin, inference type, boundary, verification state and relations. Decision/Synthesis selects Claim IDs for a concrete question and records dependence, conflicts, coverage, transferability and the action taken.

The cardinality is Source 1:N Claim and Claim N:N Decision. Front-end pages may render a combined view, but the stored facts must not be duplicated.

## IDs

- source_work_id groups editions, preprints, accepted manuscripts, releases or revisions that represent one intellectual work.
- source_manifestation_id identifies the exact version actually read.
- card_id identifies the Markdown record.
- claim_id is globally unique and stable after publication.
- decision_id identifies one decision state as of a date.
- independence_group_ids mark shared data, station networks, projects, teams or model families.
- version_family_ids connect replaced or equivalent manifestations.

Changing wording without changing the proposition updates the claim in place with Git history. Changing the proposition creates a new claim ID and links supersedes. Never silently reuse an ID for a different proposition.

## Two classifications

artifact_type describes what the source object is. evidence_roles describe what its claims do. One source has one artifact type and may have several roles. This prevents a data paper, software paper or engineering study from being forced into one scientific role.

## Structured JSON blocks

Frontmatter remains flat so Obsidian, Git and the standard-library validator can read it without a YAML dependency. Nested Claim, water_context and Decision objects use strict JSON blocks. The JSON Schemas document their contracts; scripts/validate_card.py enforces the operational subset and R01-R08.

## Four decision dimensions

Do not compress different questions into one usability score:

- relevance: central, supporting, peripheral, irrelevant;
- verification_readiness: verified, partially_verified, clue_only, currently_unusable;
- applicability: direct, conditional, transfer_check_required, not_applicable;
- decision_effect: strengthens, weakens, limits, contradicts, no_change.

Decision cards additionally use a six-dimension evidence profile: directness, internal validity, independence, precision, applicability and reproducibility. Each dimension records high, medium, low or unknown plus basis_claim_ids. There is no cross-source total score.

## Scientific status

Completion level, workflow status, AI extraction status, evidence certainty and applicability are different axes. A source can be fully extracted but scientifically weak; highly relevant but not checked; official but inapplicable; reproducible but not valid for the target basin.
